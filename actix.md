# On Actix

So much more [doc](https://actix.rs/docs/)! Very welcoming! And [plentiful examples](https://github.com/actix/examples).

Reloading seems like [a bit of a chore](https://actix.rs/docs/autoreload/). Maybe compile times for a realistic app aren't too bad?

The design of the framework appears, at first glance, very close to "paving the cow paths" of how crates.io is structured. Could be worse!

(In defense of Nickel, Actix uses a very similar concept for passing global state to request handlers)
