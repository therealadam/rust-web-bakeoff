# A Rust web bakeoff

Wherein our hero wants to know, is Rust web enough for _me_?

The contestants:

- Nickel
- Actix
- Gotham

## What I expect of a web library/framework in 2019

- A simple "Hello World" sort of endpoint
- parse path params and emit JSON
- parse JSON request body
- struct -> JSON repsonse
- JSON -> struct & update API
- router decomposition; e.g. /api/ and /pages served by separate functions/impls
- use a (global) state thing
- middleware

## Nice to have

- form handling
- some thought put into deployment
- some thought put into static assets, i.e. integrating with the explosion of front-end tooling
