# On nickel.rs

The immediate appeal is "Express-like", which bakes in a usable idea of an API to start. The single landing page of docs aren't as good as the others. 

I found the [examples](https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs/blob/master/examples) page and that helped _a lot_.

Nickel uses macro expansions for defining middleware and routers. I think this is syntactic sugar, but it's new territory for me! They do have no-macro examples though!

After skimming over all the examples, Nickel seems pretty comparable to Sinatra in scope and coverage. Rust's type system makes structured handling of JSON more easily graspable, though.
